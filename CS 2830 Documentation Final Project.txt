CS 2830 Documentation Final Project

1. Have a seperate css style sheet and I used twitter bootstrap to organize things using a 12 div span.

2. I used twitter bootstrap to organize my pages witha  fluid design so each page looks similar but with different content.  

3.The webpages were designed with PHP in mind where I have include functions to hold each header, footer, login form and other content that was similar accross the website.


4-5.There is a login on every page that gives you access to a protected page and adds a new tab to the nav bar.  You cannot access this page without logging in.

6.There is PHP on every page to include other pages and the login form is presented on every page.

7.I use GET/POST in the login.  I use POST for the login and GET to check and see if the login button was clicked in order to unset the session and destroy it.

8.We talked about this during office hours

9.If the user enters incorrect information if displays a message saying to reenter the user/pass.  I decided to not tell the user if the username or password is incorrect for security reasons.

10.The renovated page shows multiple pictures of houses.

11. There are youtube videos embedded on the protected.php page

12-15.  JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX is used to grab information from a JSON file and then display that information including a picture on the renovated.php page.

16. I also built this webpage for my dad's business and I plan on buying a domain when he is ready to launch the site.
